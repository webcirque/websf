[v1] //create a namespace named v1
前頭路途險峻又長遠 //index starts at 0
There's a long and winding road ahead
//blank line is omitted
幾朵烏雲遮住臉
A few black clouds lay over head

而那太陽卻總是不見蹤影
And the shining sun is nowhere to be seen

但有你不斷起身繼續的每步
But with every step and fall you take

總敢於接受新事物
All your thoughts and leaps of faith

雨過似乎就一定有天青
There's a silver lining somewhere in between

[pre-chorus]
閉上眼
Close your eyes
深呼吸
Breathe in slow
緩緩吐氣
Then let it go

[chorus]
當旅途漸漸變長
也別忘了聞聞玫瑰花香
Stop and smell the roses
when your journey's getting long

當生命和你唱反調
感到全身毫無能量
When you feel your life's against you
and your energy is gone

畢竟並非誰都知道
何時該讓自己放個鬆
'Cause not everybody knows when-
-it's just time to catch a break

當你累到只想自己靜一靜
When you're draining
and you just don't wanna show it

停下來聞聞玫瑰花香
Stop and smell the roses

[v2]
今天又有了新點子
想將昨天帶回到眼前
Today has found another way
to turn right into yesterday

只因時間又再次洗刷了一切
'Cause time has taken all the light again

就算我擺弄著現實
想試圖改變我的未來
But if I fiddle with reality
to try and change who I should be

最後還不是仍然呆站在起點
I'm tucking my own destiny in bed
